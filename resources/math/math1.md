2. Lessons incorporate a variety of problem types, including one-step word problems, to build understanding and mastery of core 3rd grade math topics like multiplication, division, fractions, measurement and geometry.

3. The textbook provides examples worked out step-by-step along with independent practice problems for students. Answers and step-by-step explanations are included to allow for self-checking.

4. Cumulative assessments are included to test comprehension of material from the entire year. Scores are tracked to monitor individual progress.

5. Parent materials are provided to complement lessons and support learning at home through homework assignments and practice activities.

6. This is one of the primary self-guided study resources used by 3rd grade students in Central Bucks School District to develop proficiency with third grade math content and practice applying skills through varied problem-solving approaches, as outlined in the district curriculum.<br>
