The Saxon Math 6/5 program is one of the core math curriculums used here at St. Nicholas Catholic School for our 3rd grade students. Specifically, our 3rd graders utilize the Saxon Math 6/5 3rd Grade Student Edition, written by renowned math educator Stephen Hake.

Some key aspects of this textbook that support our math program include:

It follows the incremental "spiral review" approach of Saxon Math, where concepts are introduced in small amounts and continually reviewed. This helps reinforce learning.

Lessons focus on important 3rd grade skills like multiplication, division, fractions, geometry, and measurement. Real-world word problems develop practical application.

The format provides worked examples with step-by-step explanations alongside practice problem sets for students. Self-checking answer keys are included.

Cumulative assessments and tracker charts allow teachers to monitor individual progress towards mastering 3rd grade standards.

Accompanying parent materials offer homework assignments and extra practice to further skills at home.

Overall, the Saxon Math 6/5 3rd Grade text provides a strong foundational resource for helping our students meet the math proficiency goals outlined in our curriculum. <br>
