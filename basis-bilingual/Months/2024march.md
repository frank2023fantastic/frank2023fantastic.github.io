## ChatGPT强势来袭，如何应对新挑战？
亲爱的六至十一年级学生和家长：
Dear G6-G11 families,

藉此邮件通知您，我们很荣幸地邀请到卡耐基·梅隆大学数学教授、国际奥林匹克数学基金会发展部副主席罗博深教授来我校开展主题讲座。
We are excited to announce an educational lecture provided by Professor Po-Shen Loh, a world-renowned mathematician at Carnegie Mellon University, and the IMO Foundation VP for Advancement. 

讲座主题为“ChatGPT强势来袭，如何应对新挑战？”，将于3月7日（星期四）晚5:30-7:30在学校大剧院举行，面向我校6-11年级学生和家长。罗博深教授关于该话题的全球巡讲曾得到《华尔街日报》专题报道（见附件）。学校希望通过此次分享，帮助学生对数学思维拓展、当前瞬息万变的科技发展以及未来技能培养有所启发。
With the topic of “How to Survive the ChatGPT Invasion?”, this lecture will be held on Thursday, March 7, from 5:30 pm to 7:30 pm in the school Grand Theatre, open to G6-11 students and parents. Professor Loh is traveling around the world with this talk. His tour was recently featured in the Wall Street Journal (see attached). We hope this talk introduces students to how math plays out in our daily lives, and encourages them to think of how the rapidly changing AI world will impact their future career.

因大剧院场地限制，本次讲座限定人数为500人，采取“先报先得”原则，每名学生可与一位家长共同参加。若您和学生希望前来参加，请于2月29日（本周四）前，点击下方链接完成报名，报名满额后系统将自动关闭。如报名成功，学校将发送确认邮件至您在链接中填写的联系邮箱，请确保信息填写准确无误。
